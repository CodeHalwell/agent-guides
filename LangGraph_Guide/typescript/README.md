# LangGraph.js Comprehensive TypeScript Guide

> **Package:** `@langchain/langgraph`
> **Version:** 1.2.9 (April 19, 2026) — previously 1.0.2 (November 2025)

## ⚠️ What's Changed in v1.2.8

### `createReactAgent` Moved to Toolkit Package
```typescript
// DEPRECATED (still works, but warns)
import { createReactAgent } from '@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt';

// NEW (recommended)
import { createReactAgent } from '@langgraphjs/toolkit';
```

### New Features (v1.1 → v1.2)
- **Standard JSON Schema support** (compatible with Zod 4, Valibot, ArkType) — removes validator lock-in
- **`ReducedValue` type**: define fields with custom reducers that have separate input/output schemas
- **`UntrackedValue` type**: transient state that exists during a run but is never checkpointed (reduces persistence overhead)
- **`@langgraphjs/toolkit`**: new package for prebuilt agent implementations

### Installation
```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph

# For prebuilt agent utilities
npm install @langgraphjs/toolkit
```
