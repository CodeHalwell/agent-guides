# Compaction — Python

Long-running agents blow through the context window. Compaction strategies decide which messages to keep, which to drop, and which to replace with shorter summaries — **per turn**, before the messages reach the model.

Six first-class strategies ship in `agent_framework`, plus a `CompactionProvider` that plugs any strategy into the session pipeline. Verified against `agent-framework-core==1.1.0` (`agent_framework._compaction`).

## Mental model

Compaction sees your conversation as an ordered list of **message groups** (user turn, assistant turn, tool-call group, system prompt). Each group is atomic — a tool call and its result stay together. A strategy marks groups `excluded=True` (or replaces them with a summary); the framework projects the included groups and ships them to the model. Your source history is preserved — only the model's view shrinks.

## Strategies at a glance

| Strategy | What it does | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `TruncationStrategy` | Keep the first N and last M messages; exclude the middle | Simple FIFO that preserves system + recent |
| `SlidingWindowStrategy` | Keep the last `keep_last_groups` non-system groups | Predictable recency window |
| `SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy` | Drop older tool-call groups only | Tool chatter dominates the history |
| `ToolResultCompactionStrategy` | Collapse older tool calls into one-line summaries | Keep a readable trace but cut tokens |
| `SummarizationStrategy` | LLM-summarise older groups into a single message | Long chats where earlier context still matters |
| `TokenBudgetComposedStrategy` | Run other strategies until a token budget is met | Hard limit per turn; compose lighter strategies first |

All implement `CompactionStrategy`:

```python
class CompactionStrategy(Protocol):
    async def __call__(self, messages: list[Message]) -> bool: ...
```

Returns `True` if the message list was modified.

## Sliding window — simplest

```python
from agent_framework import SlidingWindowStrategy, apply_compaction

strategy = SlidingWindowStrategy(
    keep_last_groups=20,    # keep the last 20 non-system groups
    preserve_system=True,   # never drop system messages
)

projected = await apply_compaction(messages, strategy=strategy)
```

Good default. Deterministic, no extra LLM calls, preserves system anchors.

### What "groups" means in practice

A *group* is whatever the framework's group annotator considered a single logical unit — typically a user turn, an assistant turn, or a tool-call group (a function call **plus** its tool-result message stay together). Counting groups instead of messages is what lets the strategy keep tool calls atomic: it never strands a `function_call` without its `function_result`.

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework import (
    Content,
    EXCLUDED_KEY,
    EXCLUDE_REASON_KEY,
    Message,
    SlidingWindowStrategy,
    apply_compaction,
)

# A short conversation with system anchor + 4 user/assistant pairs + a tool-call group.
messages = [
    Message(role="system", contents=[Content.from_text("Be concise.")]),
    *[
        Message(role=role, contents=[Content.from_text(f"{role} {i}")])
        for i in range(4)
        for role in ("user", "assistant")
    ],
    Message(role="assistant", contents=[Content.from_function_call(
        call_id="c1", name="lookup", arguments={"id": 42},
    )]),
    Message(role="tool", contents=[Content.from_function_result(
        call_id="c1", result={"status": "ok"},
    )]),
]

strategy = SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=2, preserve_system=True)
asyncio.run(apply_compaction(messages, strategy=strategy))

excluded = [m for m in messages if m.additional_properties.get(EXCLUDED_KEY)]
print(len(excluded), "messages excluded with reason",
      excluded[0].additional_properties.get(EXCLUDE_REASON_KEY))
# 6 messages excluded with reason sliding_window
```

Two things this snippet illustrates:

- **System messages survive `preserve_system=True`.** Even with `keep_last_groups=2`, the system anchor is untouched and isn't counted toward the kept-groups quota.
- **The tool-call group counts as one group.** Both the `function_call` and the `function_result` survive together — `keep_last_groups=2` keeps the latest user/assistant turn and the tool group, not 2 messages out of 3.

### Edge cases worth knowing

- `keep_last_groups <= 0` raises `ValueError` at construction — you cannot configure a window of size zero.
- `preserve_system=False` lets the strategy drop the system anchor too. Use this when system instructions are duplicated by an `instructions=` parameter on the agent (the framework injects them again on each call) and you don't want to pay for both copies.
- The strategy mutates messages in place via `additional_properties[EXCLUDED_KEY] = True`. Call `included_messages(messages)` to get the projected view, or filter on `EXCLUDED_KEY` directly when you want to display "32 messages collapsed" in your UI.

## Selective tool-call compaction

```python
from agent_framework import SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy

strategy = SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=3)
```

Only touches tool-call groups. Use when an agent polls APIs dozens of times — user/assistant turns keep full fidelity; older tool chatter is dropped.

## Tool-result compaction — readable summaries

```python
from agent_framework import ToolResultCompactionStrategy

strategy = ToolResultCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=1)
```

Replaces older tool-call groups with a short summary like `[Tool results: get_weather: sunny, 18°C; get_forecast: rain Tue]` instead of excluding them. You keep the provenance at a fraction of the tokens.

`keep_last_tool_call_groups=0` collapses **every** included tool-call group; the most recent ones are summarised too. `keep_last_tool_call_groups=N` (the default is `1`) leaves the newest `N` groups untouched.

### What the summary actually looks like

Given a transcript with three tool-call groups for `get_weather` / `get_forecast`, the strategy mutates the message list **in place** and inserts a synthesised summary message at the start of each compacted group while marking the original messages excluded:

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework import (
    Content,
    Message,
    ToolResultCompactionStrategy,
    apply_compaction,
)

messages = [
    Message(role="user", contents=[Content.from_text("Weather in Seattle?")]),
    Message(role="assistant", contents=[
        Content.from_function_call("c1", "get_weather", arguments={"city": "Seattle"}),
    ]),
    Message(role="tool", contents=[
        Content.from_function_result("c1", result="sunny, 18°C"),
    ]),
    Message(role="user", contents=[Content.from_text("And Friday?")]),
    Message(role="assistant", contents=[
        Content.from_function_call("c2", "get_forecast", arguments={"city": "Seattle"}),
    ]),
    Message(role="tool", contents=[
        Content.from_function_result("c2", result="clear, 22°C"),
    ]),
]

projected = asyncio.run(apply_compaction(
    messages,
    strategy=ToolResultCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=1),
))

for m in projected:
    text = m.text or ", ".join(c.type for c in m.contents)
    print(f"[{m.role:9}] {text}")
```

prints:

```text
[user     ] Weather in Seattle?
[assistant] [Tool results: get_weather: sunny, 18°C]
[user     ] And Friday?
[assistant] function_call
[tool     ] function_result
```

`apply_compaction` is the public helper that annotates groups, runs the strategy in place, and returns the projected list a model would actually receive. The first `(call_1, function_result)` pair is gone from the projection — replaced by the synthetic summary. The most recent group (`call_2`) survives untouched because `keep_last_tool_call_groups=1`. The raw `messages` list still contains the originals (with exclusion annotations) so you can render them in a debug UI or inspect annotations later.

The summary message carries `summary_of_message_ids` and `summary_of_group_ids` annotations linking back to the originals, so an audit-trail UI can offer a "show original tool calls" affordance without any extra bookkeeping.

## LLM summarisation

Uses a chat client to summarise older history into a single assistant message:

```python
from agent_framework import SummarizationStrategy
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient

summariser = SummarizationStrategy(
    client=OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    target_count=8,     # leave 8 non-system messages untouched
    threshold=4,        # trigger when included > target + threshold
)
```

Triggers only when `included_non_system_count > target_count + threshold` — idle conversations don't pay for summaries they don't need. Once triggered, the strategy walks groups oldest-first, keeps the newest ones up to `target_count`, and replaces the rest with one summary message that links back to the original group IDs via annotations.

### Domain-specific summarisation prompt

The default prompt preserves goals, decisions, and unresolved items. Override with `prompt=` when you want a different shape:

```python
support_summariser = SummarizationStrategy(
    client=OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    target_count=6,
    threshold=3,
    prompt=(
        "You are summarising a customer support conversation. "
        "Produce at most 4 bullet points covering:\n"
        "- The customer's problem and any account identifiers mentioned.\n"
        "- Diagnostic steps already attempted.\n"
        "- Agreements or promises made by the support agent.\n"
        "- Any open questions or pending escalations.\n"
        "Do NOT restate pleasantries or repeat exact quotes."
    ),
)
```

The summary message keeps `group_annotation.summary_of_group_ids` and `summary_of_message_ids` metadata so you can later walk back to the original turns — useful for audit trails or "expand this summary" UI affordances.

### Graceful fallback

If the summariser client fails (timeout, rate limit, parse error), `SummarizationStrategy` logs a warning and returns `False` *without* mutating the message list. Composed strategies (`TokenBudgetComposedStrategy`) then fall through to the next strategy. Pair with a cheap sliding-window strategy so you degrade predictably when summarisation is unavailable.

## Token-budget composed strategy

Compose cheaper strategies first; fall back to hard exclusion to meet a strict cap:

```python
from agent_framework import (
    CharacterEstimatorTokenizer,
    SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy,
    SlidingWindowStrategy,
    SummarizationStrategy,
    TokenBudgetComposedStrategy,
)
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient

summariser_client = OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-4o-mini")

strategy = TokenBudgetComposedStrategy(
    token_budget=8_000,
    tokenizer=CharacterEstimatorTokenizer(),   # swap for a real tokenizer in prod
    strategies=[
        SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=2),
        SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=30),
        SummarizationStrategy(client=summariser_client, target_count=10),
    ],
    early_stop=True,   # stop as soon as budget is satisfied
)
```

Order matters — put cheap, deterministic strategies first; summarisation last because it spends tokens. If the composed strategies still exceed budget, the built-in fallback excludes oldest non-system groups (and finally system anchors) to enforce the cap.

### Plugging in a real tokenizer

```python
import tiktoken
from agent_framework import TokenizerProtocol


class TiktokenTokenizer:
    """Implements the `TokenizerProtocol` — a single `count_tokens(text)` method."""

    def __init__(self, model: str = "gpt-4o-mini") -> None:
        self._enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)

    def count_tokens(self, text: str) -> int:
        return len(self._enc.encode(text))


strategy = TokenBudgetComposedStrategy(
    token_budget=8_000,
    tokenizer=TiktokenTokenizer(),
    strategies=[...],
)
```

`CharacterEstimatorTokenizer` ships with the framework for when you just need a rough character→token heuristic. The implementation is intentionally trivial — `max(1, len(text) // 4)` — so it never returns 0 for non-empty text and avoids dragging in a real tokenizer dependency:

```python
from agent_framework import CharacterEstimatorTokenizer

est = CharacterEstimatorTokenizer()
est.count_tokens("hello")           # 1   (5 // 4 → 1)
est.count_tokens("")                # 1   (clamped — never 0)
est.count_tokens("a" * 4_000)       # 1000
```

It's good enough for budget-aware fallbacks during dev/test. For production cost accounting use the real tokenizer that matches your model. Any object with a `count_tokens(text: str) -> int` method satisfies `TokenizerProtocol` — the protocol is structurally typed (`runtime_checkable`), so no inheritance is required.

## Wiring compaction into an agent

Two options: **per-agent** (via the chat client) or **per-session** (via `CompactionProvider`). Per-session is more common — it integrates with history providers and persists the compacted state.

### Per-session via `CompactionProvider`

```python
from agent_framework import (
    Agent,
    CompactionProvider,
    InMemoryHistoryProvider,
    SlidingWindowStrategy,
    ToolResultCompactionStrategy,
)
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient


history = InMemoryHistoryProvider()

compaction = CompactionProvider(
    before_strategy=SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=20),
    after_strategy=ToolResultCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=1),
    history_source_id=history.source_id,
)

agent = Agent(
    client=OpenAIChatClient(),
    instructions="You are a research assistant.",
    context_providers=[history, compaction],
)

session = agent.create_session()
await agent.run("Kick off research on X.", session=session)
await agent.run("Now write the summary.", session=session)   # session history compacted between turns
```

`before_strategy` runs when messages are loaded into the run; `after_strategy` compacts what's persisted back into session state so the *next* turn starts smaller. Either can be `None` to skip that phase.

#### The two-phase lifecycle in detail

Knowing exactly *when* each strategy fires lets you reason about token cost and history retention separately:

```text
agent.run(...)
   │
   ├─ HistoryProvider.load_session(...) loads stored messages into context
   ├─ CompactionProvider.before_run(...)   ← before_strategy mutates loaded context
   ├─ ──── model call(s) + tool loop ────  ← uses the (now-compacted) context
   ├─ HistoryProvider.persist(...) writes new messages into session.state
   ├─ CompactionProvider.after_run(...)    ← after_strategy mutates stored history
   │       (looked up by `history_source_id` in session.state)
   └─ return AgentResponse
```

Two practical consequences:

- **Same strategy, different goals.** A common pattern is "summarise once it gets big" — a `SummarizationStrategy` as `after_strategy` keeps storage compact, while a cheap `SlidingWindowStrategy` as `before_strategy` is a safety net in case the next turn still loads more than expected.
- **`history_source_id` must match the history provider.** The `after_strategy` looks up history under `session.state[history_source_id]`. If you change the history provider's `source_id` (say, you mount two providers as `"long_term"` and `"short_term"`) you must thread the matching id into `CompactionProvider(history_source_id=...)` or compaction silently no-ops on persist.

#### Inspecting compaction in tests

`apply_compaction` is the entry point you call directly — it's an async coroutine, so wrap it in `asyncio.run` (or `await` it from an async test). Handy in unit tests so you can assert on inclusion without spinning up an agent:

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework import (
    Message,
    SlidingWindowStrategy,
    apply_compaction,
    included_messages,
)

messages = [
    Message(role="system", contents=["Be concise."]),
    *(Message(role="user", contents=[f"q{i}"]) for i in range(10)),
]

asyncio.run(apply_compaction(messages, strategy=SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=3)))

assert [m.role for m in included_messages(messages)] == ["system", "user", "user", "user"]
```

Excluded messages remain in the original list with `EXCLUDED_KEY=True` annotations — `apply_compaction` mutates the list in place rather than returning a copy.

### Swapping in `FileHistoryProvider`

For durable sessions across process restarts, replace `InMemoryHistoryProvider` with `FileHistoryProvider` (experimental — `agent_framework._sessions`). It writes one JSON-Lines file per `session_id` under a root directory:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent, CompactionProvider, FileHistoryProvider, SlidingWindowStrategy
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient


history = FileHistoryProvider(
    storage_path="./sessions",
    skip_excluded=True,             # don't reload compacted-out messages on the next turn
)

compaction = CompactionProvider(
    before_strategy=SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=20),
    history_source_id=history.source_id,
)

agent = Agent(client=OpenAIChatClient(), context_providers=[history, compaction])

# A distinct session_id picks up the corresponding file on the next call.
session = agent.create_session(session_id="user-42")
await agent.run("Continue where we left off.", session=session)
```

`FileHistoryProvider` resolves `session_id` against `storage_path` and **rejects any id that would escape the storage directory** — `../` traversal is blocked and resolved paths are validated against the storage root. Treat the storage directory as trusted application state, not a secret store; the JSONL contents are plaintext. For multi-process deployments, use the Redis or Cosmos history providers instead so concurrent writers don't race on the same file.

The `store_inputs`, `store_outputs`, `store_context_messages`, and `load_messages` flags let the same class act as an audit log (`load_messages=False`), a write-only evaluation trace, or a full primary store:

```python
audit_log = FileHistoryProvider(
    storage_path="./audit",
    source_id="audit",
    load_messages=False,            # never reload — purely a write destination
    store_inputs=True,
    store_outputs=True,
    store_context_messages=True,    # also capture messages injected by other providers
)
```

### Per-agent via chat client

Any chat client accepts `compaction_strategy=`. This applies to every call made through that client, regardless of session:

```python
client = OpenAIChatClient(
    compaction_strategy=SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=30),
    tokenizer=TiktokenTokenizer(),
)
agent = Agent(client=client, instructions="…")
```

Use this for stateless agents or when you want a client-wide safety net independent of session compaction.

### Per-run override

Pass `compaction_strategy=` and `tokenizer=` to `agent.run(...)` for one-off overrides — handy in tests.

```python
await agent.run("…", compaction_strategy=SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=5))
```

## Custom strategies

Anything callable that matches the protocol works:

```python
async def drop_old_errors(messages: list[Message]) -> bool:
    changed = False
    for m in messages:
        if m.role == "tool" and "error" in (m.text or "").lower():
            from agent_framework._compaction import set_excluded
            changed = set_excluded(m, excluded=True, reason="old_error") or changed
    return changed
```

Compose with the built-ins via `TokenBudgetComposedStrategy` or call inline.

## Inspecting what compaction did

Framework helpers let you see the before/after split:

```python
from agent_framework import included_messages, included_token_count

print(len(included_messages(messages)))  # how many survived
print(included_token_count(messages))    # estimated tokens kept
```

Excluded messages stay in the list tagged with `EXCLUDED_KEY=True` and `EXCLUDE_REASON_KEY` — useful for debugging and UI display ("32 messages compacted").

## Patterns

**Default for chat UIs.** `SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=20)` as `before_strategy`, `ToolResultCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=1)` as `after_strategy`. Predictable, no judge tokens.

**Research agents with long plans.** Use `SummarizationStrategy` with a cheap model — Phi-3 / Haiku / gpt-4o-mini. The summary retains goals and open questions so the agent stays on-track past 50 turns.

**Strict SLA on context size.** `TokenBudgetComposedStrategy(token_budget=32_000, ...)` guarantees you never send >32k tokens, with deterministic fallback even if summarisation fails.

**Multi-tool pipelines.** Tool results often dwarf user/assistant turns. `SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=2)` preserves the important reasoning while dropping the polling noise.

**A/B test strategies.** Run `evaluate_agent` (see [Evaluation](./microsoft_agent_framework_python_evaluation/)) twice with different `compaction_strategy=` overrides and compare pass rates.

## End-to-end recipes for each strategy

The full constructor signatures are short. Each recipe builds on the same shared scaffolding — instantiate it once and reuse across the rest of this section:

```python
import tiktoken
from agent_framework import (
    InMemoryHistoryProvider,
    TokenizerProtocol,
)
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient


class TiktokenTokenizer:
    """Implements the `TokenizerProtocol` — a single `count_tokens(text)` method."""

    def __init__(self, model: str = "gpt-4o-mini") -> None:
        self._enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)

    def count_tokens(self, text: str) -> int:
        return len(self._enc.encode(text))


# Cheap model used for summarisation only — separate from the agent's main model.
summary_client = OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-4o-mini")
tokenizer: TokenizerProtocol = TiktokenTokenizer()
history = InMemoryHistoryProvider()
```

### `SummarizationStrategy` — long research conversations

When earlier context still matters but you don't want to ship every turn, summarise the older portion with a cheap model and keep the newest turns intact:

```python
from agent_framework import (
    Agent,
    CompactionProvider,
    SummarizationStrategy,
)

summariser = SummarizationStrategy(
    client=summary_client,           # defined in the shared scaffolding above
    target_count=6,        # keep ~6 most-recent non-system messages verbatim
    threshold=4,           # trigger once we exceed target_count + threshold = 10
    prompt=(
        "Summarise the conversation so far. Preserve: stated goals, open questions, "
        "decisions already made, and unresolved blockers. Drop chit-chat and pleasantries. "
        "Keep the summary under 200 words."
    ),
)

agent = Agent(
    client=OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-4o"),
    instructions="You are a research assistant for a multi-week project.",
    context_providers=[
        history,
        CompactionProvider(after_strategy=summariser, history_source_id=history.source_id),
    ],
)
```

`SummarizationStrategy` writes back-pointers (`SUMMARY_OF_MESSAGE_IDS_KEY`, `SUMMARY_OF_GROUP_IDS_KEY`) on the new summary message and `SUMMARIZED_BY_SUMMARY_ID_KEY` on each replaced message — so debugging tools can show "this summary covered turns 2–14".

If the summariser call fails, the strategy logs a warning and returns `False` — your conversation continues uncompacted rather than dying. Pair with a `SlidingWindowStrategy` as a safety net for the next turn.

### `TokenBudgetComposedStrategy` — guarantee a context ceiling

Run cheaper strategies first; fall through to summarisation only when needed; have a deterministic fallback that excludes oldest groups when even the LLM summariser couldn't squeeze under budget:

```python
from agent_framework import (
    SlidingWindowStrategy,
    SummarizationStrategy,
    TokenBudgetComposedStrategy,
    ToolResultCompactionStrategy,
)

# `summary_client` and `tokenizer` come from the shared scaffolding above.
budget_strategy = TokenBudgetComposedStrategy(
    token_budget=24_000,                 # never ship more than 24k tokens
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    early_stop=True,                     # stop as soon as we're under budget
    strategies=[
        # 1. Cheapest first — drop tool-call chatter.
        ToolResultCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=2),
        # 2. Then trim middle of the conversation.
        SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=30),
        # 3. Last resort — summarise older content with a cheap model.
        SummarizationStrategy(client=summary_client, target_count=12, threshold=4),
    ],
)
```

The composed strategy applies each step in order, refreshes token counts, and stops when `early_stop=True` and the budget is met. If after running every step the count is still over, it deterministically excludes the oldest non-system groups one at a time — no run ever sends more than `token_budget`. System anchors are dropped only as a last resort.

### `SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy` — tool-heavy agents

Polling-style tools (status checks, retries) bloat history fast. Keep just the most recent tool-call group:

```python
from agent_framework import SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy

trim_tools = SelectiveToolCallCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=1)
```

`keep_last_tool_call_groups=0` drops every tool-call group — useful when the assistant has summarised the result into prose and the raw call/response is no longer load-bearing.

### Mixing strategies — `before_strategy` ≠ `after_strategy`

The two phases run on different message lists with different goals. A common production layout:

```python
provider = CompactionProvider(
    # Read-time safety net — keeps the live request affordable even if persisted history grew.
    before_strategy=SlidingWindowStrategy(keep_last_groups=40),
    # Persist-time pruning — what gets stored for the next turn.
    after_strategy=TokenBudgetComposedStrategy(
        token_budget=8_000,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        strategies=[
            ToolResultCompactionStrategy(keep_last_tool_call_groups=1),
            SummarizationStrategy(client=summary_client, target_count=8),
        ],
    ),
    history_source_id=history.source_id,
)
```

Read-side window is generous; persisted-side budget is tight. The next turn loads at most 8k tokens, then `before_strategy` prevents accidentally re-loading more if a different provider also wrote into context.

## Inspecting state with the framework constants

The annotation keys are exported as constants — use them when you need to inspect compaction decisions in middleware or debug tooling without re-typing the underlying string:

```python
from agent_framework import (
    EXCLUDED_KEY,
    EXCLUDE_REASON_KEY,
    GROUP_ANNOTATION_KEY,
    GROUP_KIND_KEY,
    SUMMARIZED_BY_SUMMARY_ID_KEY,
)


def explain_compaction(messages):
    for m in messages:
        excluded = m.additional_properties.get(EXCLUDED_KEY, False)
        reason = m.additional_properties.get(EXCLUDE_REASON_KEY, "")
        group = m.additional_properties.get(GROUP_ANNOTATION_KEY) or {}
