# AG2 (AutoGen) Production Guide

**Version:** 0.11.5
**Last Updated:** April 2026
**Focus:** Enterprise Deployment & Best Practices

## Overview

This guide covers best practices for deploying AG2 agents in production environments, focusing on reliability, scalability, and security.

## Deployment Strategies

### Dockerization

Containerize your AG2 agents for consistent deployment.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Serverless Deployment

Deploy agents as serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for event-driven workloads.

## Error Handling & Resilience

*   **Retries:** Implement retry logic for LLM API calls.
*   **Fallbacks:** Define fallback behaviors if an agent fails to generate a valid response.
*   **Logging:** Use structured logging to track agent interactions and errors.

## Security

*   **Sandboxing:** Run code execution agents in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container) to prevent malicious actions.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
*   **API Key Management:** Use environment variables or secrets management services to store API keys.

## Monitoring & Observability

*   **Tracing:** Trace agent conversations to understand the flow of execution.
*   **Metrics:** Monitor token usage, latency, and error rates.
*   **Cost Management:** Track API costs and implement budget limits.

## Scaling

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Run multiple instances of your agent service behind a load balancer.
*   **State Management:** Use a distributed store (e.g., Redis) to manage conversation state across instances.
