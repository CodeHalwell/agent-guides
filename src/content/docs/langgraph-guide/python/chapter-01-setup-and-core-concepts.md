# Chapter 1 — Setup & Core Concepts

**What you'll learn:** install LangGraph, understand the mental model, and learn the four primitives — **state, nodes, edges, compilation** — that every graph builds on.

**Time:** ~15 minutes.

> This is the first chapter of the Zero → Hero path. Next chapter builds your first real agent on top of these primitives.

## Introduction & Fundamentals

### What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building stateful, long-running agent systems. Unlike high-level abstractions that hide complexity, LangGraph gives you full control over:

- **Agent behaviour** through explicit state management
- **Conditional logic** with fine-grained routing
- **Persistence** with durable execution across failures
- **Memory** both short-term (checkpoints) and long-term (stores)
- **Human oversight** through interrupts and approvals

Built by LangChain Inc, it's inspired by Google's Pregel and Apache Beam, providing production-grade infrastructure trusted by Klarna, Replit, and Elastic.

### Key Mental Model

Think of LangGraph as a **state machine with graphs**:

```
Initial State → Node A → Condition → [Node B or Node C] → Final State
                         ↓
                    Checkpoint saved
```

Each node is a Python function. State flows through edges. Conditions route based on logic. Checkpoints persist progress.

## Installation & Setup

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Core LangGraph
pip install langgraph langchain-core

# Async support
pip install aiosqlite

# For database checkpointing
pip install langgraph[postgres]  # PostgreSQL support
pip install psycopg2-binary      # PostgreSQL adapter

# LLM providers (example with Anthropic)
pip install langchain-anthropic

# Development & debugging
pip install langgraph-cli        # CLI tools
```

### Project Structure

```

### Minimal Setup Example


```python
# agent.py
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    message: str
    response: str

def process_node(state: State):
    return {"response": f"Processed: {state['message']}"}

# Build graph
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("process", process_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "process")
builder.add_edge("process", END)

# Compile with memory
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())

# Execute
result = graph.invoke(
    {"message": "Hello"},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "user-1"}}
)
print(result)
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. State Schema

State is the single source of truth for your graph. Define it with TypedDict or Pydantic:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class ChatState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]  # Merges new + old messages
    user_id: str
    context: dict
    should_continue: bool

# The add_messages reducer automatically appends new messages
# If you pass {"messages": [new_msg]}, it merges with existing
```

**Key insight**: The reducer function (like `add_messages`) defines how state updates combine with existing state.

Custom reducer example:

```python
from operator import add

class CounterState(TypedDict):
    count: Annotated[int, add]  # 5 + 3 = 8 (not replaced)
    last_update: str

class AppendListState(TypedDict):
    items: Annotated[list, lambda x, y: x + y]  # Custom append logic
```

### 2. Nodes

Nodes are Python functions that receive state and return updates:

```python
def my_node(state: State) -> dict:
    """Process state and return updates."""
    processed = transform(state["data"])
    return {
        "data": processed,
        "step_count": state.get("step_count", 0) + 1
    }

# Async nodes
async def async_node(state: State) -> dict:
    result = await expensive_operation(state["data"])
    return {"result": result}
```

**Critical**: Return only the fields you're updating. Other fields merge automatically.

### 3. Edges

Edges connect nodes and define control flow:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

builder = StateGraph(State)

# Fixed edge: A → B always
builder.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")

# START/END pseudo-nodes
builder.add_edge(START, "node_a")      # Entry point
builder.add_edge("node_b", END)        # Exit point

# Conditional edge: Choose next node based on state
def should_continue(state: State) -> str:
    if state["counter"] > 5:
        return "finish"
    return "loop"

builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "decision",
    should_continue,
    {
        "finish": END,
        "loop": "decision"
    }
)
```

### 4. Compilation

The `.compile()` method turns your graph into an executable Pregel engine:

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver

# Compile with persistence
checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("checkpoints.db")
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Without persistence (in-memory only)
graph = builder.compile()
```

### 5. Execution

Multiple ways to run your graph:


```python
# Synchronous - blocking
result = graph.invoke(
    {"message": "Hello"},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "user-1"}}
)

# Streaming - get updates as they happen
for event in graph.stream(
    {"message": "Hello"},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "user-1"}},
    stream_mode="values"  # or "updates" or "debug"
):
    print(event)

# Batch - process multiple inputs
results = graph.batch(
    [{"message": "A"}, {"message": "B"}],
    configs=[
        {"configurable": {"thread_id": f"user-{i}"}}
        for i in range(2)
    ]
)

# Asynchronous
import asyncio
async_result = await graph.ainvoke({"message": "Hello"}, config={...})

# Streaming async
async for event in graph.astream(...):
    print(event)
```
