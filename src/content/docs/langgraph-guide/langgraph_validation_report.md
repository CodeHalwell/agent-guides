## Changes Made

1.  **Split into language-specific directories:**
    - Created a `python/` subdirectory within `LangGraph_Guide`.
    - Moved all existing Python-specific guides (`.md` files) into the new `python/` directory.
    - Created a new top-level `README.md` to serve as a landing page with links to the language-specific guides.

2.  **Updated 2 code examples:**
    - In `langgraph_comprehensive_guide.md`, the "Supervisor Pattern" example was updated to remove the deprecated `create_react_agent` and now uses the modern `create_tool_calling_agent` and `AgentExecutor`.
    - In the same file, the "ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)" example was also updated to replace `create_react_agent` with the current `AgentExecutor` pattern.

3.  **Corrected 0 deprecated methods:** (Covered by the code example updates).

4.  **Added 1 missing feature guide:**
    - Created the `langgraph_advanced_implementations.md` file as requested, with detailed sections on production architecture, multi-framework integration, performance optimization, and advanced agentic patterns.

5.  **Updated Documentation Links:**
    - The "Official Docs" link in `python/README.md` was updated to point to the more user-friendly `https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/`.

## Issues Found

- The primary issue was the use of the deprecated `create_react_agent` function in key examples, which could mislead users. This has been corrected.
- The documentation was not structured by language, which has also been resolved.

---

## Recommendations

- The `Langgraph_Guide_Typescript` directory should be reviewed next and potentially moved into a `typescript/` subdirectory within the main `LangGraph_Guide` to centralize all LangGraph documentation, as per the new structure.
- A full review of all code snippets across all files should be conducted to ensure they align with the latest minor version updates of LangGraph v1.0+, as this review focused on major deprecations.
