# Get conversation history
history = client.beta.conversations.get_history(
    conversation_id=conversation.id
)

# Create branch to explore SQL path
sql_branch = client.beta.conversations.restart(
    conversation_id=conversation.id,
    from_entry_id=history.entries[0].id,
    inputs="Let's explore the SQL option in detail"
)

# Create another branch for NoSQL path
nosql_branch = client.beta.conversations.restart(
    conversation_id=conversation.id,

## Connector Best Practices

### 1. Combining Multiple Connectors

```python
# Powerful agent with all connectors
agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    model="mistral-large-latest",
    name="Full-Featured Agent",
    instructions=(
        "You are a comprehensive AI assistant with multiple capabilities: "
        "1. Execute Python code for calculations and analysis "
        "2. Generate images when visual content is needed "
        "3. Search the web for current information "
        "4. Retrieve information from our document library "
        "5. Remember all previous conversations "
        "Choose the appropriate tool(s) for each task. "
        "Combine tools when beneficial (e.g., web search + code for data analysis)."
    ),
    tools=[
        {"type": "code_interpreter"},
        {"type": "image_generation"},
        {"type": "web_search", "config": {"enable_premium_sources": True}},
        {"type": "document_retrieval", "config": {"library_id": "lib_xxx"}}
    ]
)
```

### 2. Tool Selection Strategy

```python
# Instruct agent on tool selection
instructions = """
You have access to multiple tools. Use them wisely:

- Code Interpreter: For calculations, data analysis, algorithms
- Image Generation: For visual content creation
- Web Search: For current events, recent information, general knowledge
- Document Library: For company-specific information, internal docs
- Memory: Always active, reference past conversations

Tool Selection Rules:
1. Internal docs (RAG) before web search for company info
2. Code execution for anything numerical or computational
3. Web search for current events (recency matters)
4. Image generation when visual explanation helps
5. Combine tools when one feeds into another

Always explain which tool you're using and why.
"""
```

### 3. Error Recovery

```python
# Build robust error handling into instructions
instructions = """
When using tools:

1. Code Execution Errors:
   - Explain what went wrong
   - Show the error message
   - Provide corrected code
   - Re-execute if possible

2. Web Search Issues:
   - If no results, try alternative search terms
   - If sources conflict, acknowledge uncertainty
   - Always cite sources

3. Document Retrieval:
   - If not found in docs, acknowledge limitation
   - Offer to search web as fallback
   - Don't hallucinate document content

4. Image Generation:
   - If result doesn't match, refine prompt
   - Offer to regenerate with adjustments
"""
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

```python
# Configure connectors for optimal performance

agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    model="mistral-medium-latest",
    name="Optimized Agent",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "code_interpreter",
            "config": {
                "timeout": 15,  # Shorter timeout for faster failures
                "max_iterations": 3
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "web_search",
            "config": {
                "max_results": 5,  # Fewer results = faster
                "recency_bias": True
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "document_retrieval",
            "config": {
                "max_documents": 3,  # Fewer docs = faster
                "similarity_threshold": 0.75  # Higher threshold = more precise
            }
        }
    ]
)
```

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Code Execution Security

```python
# Code execution runs in secure sandbox
# No network access, no file persistence

# However, instruct agent on safe practices
instructions = """
Code Execution Security:
- Never attempt to access network resources
- Don't try to execute system commands
- Avoid infinite loops (timeout will kill)
- Don't process sensitive user data without confirmation
- Validate all user-provided data before processing
"""
```

### 2. Web Search Privacy

```python
# Web search queries are logged
# Be mindful of sensitive information

instructions = """
Web Search Privacy:
- Avoid searching for user PII
- Generalize searches when possible
- Warn user if search might expose sensitive data
- Prefer document library for confidential info
"""
```

### 3. Document Library Access Control

```python
# Ensure proper library permissions

# Create agent with specific library access
agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    model="mistral-medium-latest",
    name="Restricted Doc Agent",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "document_retrieval",
            "config": {
                "library_id": "lib_public_docs_only",  # Restricted library
            }
        }
    ]
)

# Don't mix public and confidential documents in same library
```

### 4. Memory and Data Retention

```python
# Consider data retention policies

# For sensitive conversations, implement cleanup
def cleanup_old_conversations(client, agent_id, days_old=90):
    """Archive conversations older than specified days"""
    conversations = client.beta.conversations.list(agent_id=agent_id)

    for conv in conversations:
        age_days = (datetime.now() - conv.created_at).days
        if age_days > days_old:
            # Archive or delete
            client.beta.conversations.archive(conversation_id=conv.id)
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Connector Latency

| Connector | Typical Latency | Optimization Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Code Execution | 2-5 seconds | Reduce iteration count, optimize code |
| Image Generation | 10-15 seconds | Clear prompts, avoid regeneration |
| Web Search | 1-3 seconds | Limit results, specific queries |
| Document Retrieval | 0.1-0.3 seconds | Higher similarity threshold, fewer docs |
| Persistent Memory | 0.05-0.2 seconds | No optimization needed (fast) |

### 2. Parallel Tool Execution

```python
# Agent automatically parallelizes when possible

conversation = client.beta.conversations.start(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    inputs="""
    Perform these tasks:
    1. Search web for current stock market trends
    2. Retrieve our Q4 financial report from docs
    3. Generate chart visualization

    Then combine all information into analysis
    """
)

# Agent will:
# 1. Execute web search and document retrieval in parallel
# 2. Wait for both to complete
# 3. Use code execution to generate chart
# 4. Synthesize results
```

### 3. Caching Strategies

```python
# Document library has built-in caching
# Web search results cached for ~5 minutes

# Leverage conversation memory as cache
conversation = client.beta.conversations.start(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    inputs="Search for latest AI trends"
)

# Later in same conversation
conversation = client.beta.conversations.append(
    conversation_id=conversation.id,
    inputs="Based on those trends you found, what should we focus on?"
)

# Agent reuses search results from memory instead of re-searching
```

### 4. Model Selection for Connectors

```python
# Different models have different connector strengths

# For code-heavy tasks: mistral-large-latest (better reasoning)
code_agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    model="mistral-large-latest",
    name="Code Expert",
    tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
)

# For search-heavy tasks: mistral-medium-latest (faster, good enough)
search_agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    model="mistral-medium-latest",
    name="Research Assistant",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search"}]
)

# For RAG: mistral-large-latest (better comprehension)
rag_agent = client.beta.agents.create(
    model="mistral-large-latest",
    name="Doc Expert",
    tools=[{"type": "document_retrieval"}]
)
```
