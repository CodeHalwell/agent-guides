# CrewAI Complete Technical Guide
## Comprehensive Documentation for Building Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems

> **Current Version:** 1.14.2 (April 17, 2026) — previously 1.5.0 (November 2025)

Welcome to the complete CrewAI technical documentation resource. This comprehensive guide covers everything from fundamental concepts to advanced production deployment of sophisticated multi-agent systems using CrewAI.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes Since v1.5.0

### `CodeInterpreterTool` Removed (v1.14)
`CodeInterpreterTool` has been removed from the public API. Remove any references to it:
```python
# REMOVED - will raise ImportError
from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

# Alternative: use the built-in code execution pattern via task instructions
```

### `CrewStructuredTool` Moved to Internal API
`CrewStructuredTool` is no longer part of the public interface. Use standard tool definitions instead.

### `stop` Parameter No Longer Sent to GPT-5 / o-series Models (v1.13)
CrewAI now detects model capabilities and skips unsupported parameters. If you relied on stop-sequence behavior with these models, test your workflows with v1.13+.

### v1.10.0 Was Yanked
Version 1.10.0 was yanked from PyPI. Use 1.10.1 or later.

## 🆕 What's New in v1.14.2 (April 17, 2026)

- **Checkpoint forking with lineage tracking**: branch execution from any saved checkpoint and track the fork graph
- **`from_checkpoint` on `Agent.kickoff`**: resume a crew run from a named checkpoint directly in code
- **Checkpoint CLI expanded**: `crewai checkpoint resume`, `crewai checkpoint diff`, and `crewai checkpoint prune` commands for managing checkpoint lifecycle
- **Template management CLI**: `crewai template` commands for creating and managing project templates
- **Enriched LLM token tracking**: token counts now include `reasoning_tokens` and `cache_creation_tokens` alongside standard in/out tokens
- **Scoped streaming handlers**: chunk handlers are scoped per-run to prevent contamination across concurrent crew executions
- **Security patches**: authlib, langchain-text-splitters, and pypdf updated; cryptography pinned to 46.0.7 (CVE-2026-39892)
- **`flow_finished` event fix**: event now correctly fires after HITL resume in Flows
- **Bedrock tool call argument preservation fix**: fixed argument dropping when routing through Amazon Bedrock Converse API
- **Cyclic JSON schema fix**: MCP tool resolution now correctly handles cyclic JSON schema references

## 🆕 What's New in v1.14.1 (April 9, 2026)

- **Async checkpoint TUI browser**: interactive terminal browser for inspecting and managing saved checkpoints
- **Streaming output context managers**: `aclose()`/`close()` and `async with` support on streaming outputs for clean resource handling
- **`BaseProvider` as Pydantic `BaseModel`**: provider backends now use `provider_type` discriminator for type-safe configuration
- **`tomlkit`-based devtools CLI**: more reliable TOML parsing in the CLI tooling
- **Dynamic tool field exclusion**: denylist is now computed dynamically rather than hardcoded, allowing custom tool fields
- **CVE-2026-1839**: transformers dependency bumped to ≥5.5.0

## 🆕 What's New in v1.14.0 (April 7, 2026)

- **Checkpoint System** (`CheckpointConfig` + `SqliteProvider`): save crew state at each task boundary; resume from the last checkpoint after failures
  ```python
  from crewai import Crew, CheckpointConfig
  crew = Crew(
      agents=[...], tasks=[...],
      checkpoint_config=CheckpointConfig(provider="sqlite", db_path="crew.db")
  )
  ```
  New CLI commands: `crewai checkpoint list` and `crewai checkpoint info`
- **Structured outputs with Pydantic** (v1.9): agents can return typed `BaseModel` instances via `response_format`
- **Before/after tool call hooks** (v1.9.1): `CrewAgentExecutor` lifecycle hooks around tool calls
- **Native vision support** (v1.13): GPT-5 and newer o-series multimodal models
- **SSRF and path traversal protections** (v1.14): URL and path validation for RAG tools
- **Enterprise RBAC and SSO** (v1.13): role-based access control documentation added
- **MCP Custom Server support** (v1.11): define and connect custom MCP servers
- **Memory classes made serializable** (v1.10/1.11)

## Key Concepts Glossary

### Agent
An autonomous AI entity with a specific role, goal, backstory, and available tools. Agents make decisions independently whilst collaborating with other agents.

### Task
A discrete unit of work assigned to an agent with clear description, expected output, and success criteria.

### Crew
A managed collection of agents and tasks that work together to accomplish objectives. The crew orchestrates execution, manages memory, and ensures collaboration.

### Process
The execution workflow that determines how tasks are assigned and executed. Options include sequential, hierarchical, and custom processes.

### Tool
An external capability that agents can use to perform actions beyond text generation, such as file operations, web scraping, or API calls.

### Memory
Storage systems that retain information across tasks and sessions. Includes short-term (current session), long-term (persistent), and entity memory.

### LLM (Large Language Model)
The underlying artificial intelligence model that powers agent reasoning. CrewAI supports various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models).

### Backstory
Contextual narrative provided to an agent that frames its expertise, experience, and approach to problem-solving.

### Pydantic Model
Type-safe output specification ensuring structured, validated data returns from tasks.
