## 📋 Overview

This documentation suite provides exhaustive coverage of the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), from foundational concepts to advanced enterprise deployments. It's designed for developers at all levels—from beginners learning agentic programming to experts building complex multi-agent systems.

ADK is an open-source, code-first framework optimised for building sophisticated AI agents with Google's Gemini models and Google Cloud services. It emphasises modularity, scalability, and production-readiness. ADK now supports **Python, TypeScript, Go, and Java**.

> **New language:** ADK for **TypeScript** was announced in December 2025. See the [TypeScript guide](typescript/) for documentation.
> **Go SDK reached 1.0 GA** on April 8, 2026 — production-ready with OTel, A2A 1.0, YAML config, and plugin system.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Agents
Autonomous entities that process queries using reasoning, tools, and models.

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="my_agent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    instruction="Your system prompt here",
    tools=[tool1, tool2]
)
```

### Runners
Manage agent execution, sessions, and lifecycle.

```python
runner = Runner(
    app_name="my_app",
    agent=agent,
    session_service=session_service
)
```

### Tools
Functions agents can invoke to perform actions or retrieve information.

```python
@agent_tool
def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information."""
    pass
```

### Multi-Agent Systems
Hierarchical or orchestrated compositions of agents for complex workflows.

```python
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="coordinator",
    instruction="Coordinate specialist agents",
    sub_agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3]
)
```

### Sessions
Persistent or temporary storage for agent state and conversation history.

```python
# In-memory (development)
InMemorySessionService()

# Persistent (production)
FirestoreSessionService(project_id="my-project")
```

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### Model Costs (per million tokens)
| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.075 | $0.30 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $3.00 | $12.00 |
| Gemini 2.5 Ultra | $15.00 | $60.00 |

### Cost Optimisation Tips
1. Use Flash model for simple tasks
2. Implement context caching for large static contexts
3. Use shorter prompts and responses where possible
4. Monitor token usage with logging
5. Implement rate limiting and quotas

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Built-In
- API authentication via service accounts
- Input validation schemas
- Safe defaults for model safety settings
- Secure session storage in Firestore

### Recommended
- Rate limiting per user
- Input sanitisation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secret management with Secret Manager
- Network security groups/VPCs
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Typical Latencies
| Operation | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Simple query | 100-300ms | Flash model, no tools |
| Tool invocation | 200-500ms | Includes tool execution |
| Complex reasoning | 500ms-2s | Pro model, multiple steps |
| Multi-agent | 1-5s | Sequential or parallel |

### Throughput (Cloud Run)
- Single instance: ~10-50 concurrent requests
- Load balanced: 100+ concurrent requests
- Horizontal scaling: Unlimited with proper setup
