# OpenAI Agents SDK Complete Guide Collection (2026 Edition)

**🎯 PRODUCTION-READY | Official Swarm Replacement | Python 3.10+**

Welcome to the comprehensive guide collection for the OpenAI Agents SDK, the **official production-ready replacement** for the experimental Swarm framework. Build enterprise-grade multi-agent AI applications with confidence.

> **Current Version:** 0.14.2 (April 18, 2026) | **Previous:** 0.6.1 (November 2025)

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes in Recent Versions

> **If upgrading from 0.6.x, read this section carefully before updating.**

### Requires `openai` v2.x (Breaking)
The SDK now requires `openai` >= 2.0. The v1.x `openai` package is **no longer supported**.
```bash
pip install "openai>=2.0" openai-agents
```

### Python 3.9 Dropped
Python 3.9 is no longer supported. Minimum version is now **Python 3.10**.

### Sync function tools now run on worker threads
Synchronous callables in function tools now use `asyncio.to_thread(...)`. If your sync tools rely on thread-local state, migrate them to `async` tools.

### MCP error handling semantics changed
Local MCP tool failures now propagate as exceptions by default and abort the run. To return a model-visible error string instead, configure `failure_error_function`:
```python
agent = Agent(..., mcp_config={"failure_error_function": lambda error: str(error)})
```

### `Agent#as_tool()` type narrowed
Return type is now `FunctionTool` instead of `Tool`. Update any type annotations accordingly.

## 🚀 What's New in 2026

### ⭐ **NEW: Sandbox Agents (v0.14)**
Agents can now operate inside persistent, isolated workspaces with files, directories, Git repos, snapshots, and resume support. Multiple backends: local Unix, Docker, Blaxel, E2B, Modal, Runloop, Vercel.

```python
from agents.sandbox import SandboxAgent, Manifest

agent = SandboxAgent(
    name="CodeAgent",
    instructions="You are a coding assistant",
    manifest=Manifest(files={"main.py": "print('hello')"})
)
result = await agent.run("Improve this script")
```

### ⭐ **NEW: WebSocket Transport for Responses API (v0.13)**
Opt-in WebSocket transport for OpenAI Responses models enables low-latency multi-turn conversations.
```python
from agents import responses_websocket_session

async with responses_websocket_session() as session:
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "Hello", session=session)
```

### ⭐ **2025 Features Guide**
- Built-in tracing and visualization
- Provider-agnostic support (100+ LLMs)
- Enhanced guardrails and session management
- MCP integration
- Fine-tuning and evaluation integration
**[2025 Features Guide →](openai_agents_sdk_2025_features.md)**

### ⭐ **Swarm Migration Guide**
OpenAI has officially deprecated Swarm in favor of the Agents SDK. **[Complete Migration Guide →](openai_agents_sdk_swarm_migration_guide.md)**
